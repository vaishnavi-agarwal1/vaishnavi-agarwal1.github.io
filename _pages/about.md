I am a PhD student in the [Economics and Public Policy program at Tufts University](https://as.tufts.edu/economics/academics/phd-program/neubauer-family-program-economics-and-public-policy-phd). I am interested in development and environmental economics.

Previously, I worked as a pre-doctoral research assistant at [Y-RISE](https://yrise.yale.edu/) at Yale University and at [CEP](https://cep.lse.ac.uk/) at the London School of Economics (LSE). I hold an MSc. in Economics from LSE and a B.A. in Economics from Ashoka University.
